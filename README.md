# fashion-mnist-with-tensorflow-and-data-batches
Image Classification for "Fashion MNIST" dataset with Tensorflow / Keras and technic of batching.

Process:
-Create training,validation and test data batches, because Tensorflow is more efficient with batch.
-Map augmentation function to training batches and normalize function to the all of these 3 batches.
-Use Sequential API
-Adding Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout techniques.
